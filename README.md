# Mashup project, V2

A work in progress, Artifacts By Origin intends to collect historic items from various museum collections that originate from the same location.

On page load, the area presented is Egypt's famed "Valley of the Kings." Clicking on any of the marked historic sites returns a list of ancient items originating at that site. These items are currently in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (www.metmuseum.org). Clicking on the object's title will take you to the Met's official description and a photo of the object.

The search can involve any historic site. Refocusing the map to another geographic area and clicking a historic site will yield search results of items in the Metropolitan Museum of Art from that site.

The next iteration of this project aims to add items from the British Museum to the search results.

By linking the digital resources of various museums by a location search, this project intends to reunite artifacts with a common origin and offer an opportunity to see common characteristics in a new way.
